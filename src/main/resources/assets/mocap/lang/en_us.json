It will record all your movements or movements of a player given as an argument. \n- Then, you can stop recording using \"/mocap recording stop\" and save it with \"/mocap recording save <name>\".\n- Use \"/mocap playing start <name>\" to play recording.\n- You can also create scenes to which you can add multiple recordings or other scenes, with parameters like player name, position offset, or start delay.\n- To create scene use \"/mocap scenes add <scene_name>\". Then, add your recording using \"/mocap scenes addTo <scene_name> <recording_name> [delay] [x_offset] [y_offset] [z_offset] [player_name]\" (you can skip arguments in square brackets if you want).\n- To play scene use \"/mocap playing start .<scene_name>\" - you need to put a dot before the scene name.\n- By putting a dot before name, when using \"/mocap scenes addTo ...\", you can also add scenes to other scenes.",
