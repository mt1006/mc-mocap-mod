===Version 1.2.1===
-Fixed a compatibility issue causing skin top layer not being visible (thanks KlashRaick, JLUsr and efi1212 for reporting).
-Fixed fake players not being removed from the server level causing memory leaks, performance issues, strange mob behaviour, problems with placing blocks, blocks staying activated and probably many other bad things (thanks KlashRaick for reporting).
-When mod is not installed on a client-side, the server now sends text with English translation instead of translation keys.

===Version 1.2===
-Placing, breaking and interacting with blocks is now recorded.
-Skins can now be set from the mineskin.org URL.
-Added setting "playBlockActions" which by default is enabled and controls whether placing, breaking and block interactions are played back.
-Added setting "setBlockStates" which by default is enabled and causes block states to be reset on playback start.
-Added setting "allowMineskinRequests" which by default is enabled and allows HTTPS requests to mineskin.org to load skins.
-Added optional argument "mineskinURL" to "/mocap scenes addTo" that can be used to set skin from the mineskin.org URL.
-Added optional arguments "playerName" and "mineskinURL" to "/mocap playing start".
-Removed "startPos" optional argument from "/mocap playing start" (it didn't work anyway)
-Item enchantments are now recorded.
-Using off-hand item or trident with riptide enchantment is now properly recorded.
-Fake players can now interact with pressure plates and tripwires.
-Fixed multiple issues with Minecraft and mod compatibility caused by UUID duplicates.
-Fixed files being loaded and saved to the same directory after switching saves on the client.
-Fixed server freezing after setting "playingSpeed" to extremely high value.

-Added Chinese [simplified] translation (thanks to Kasualix).

===Version 1.1.1===

===Version 1.1===

-Added setting "playingSpeed" that changes playing speed.
